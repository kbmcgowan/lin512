        "All derivation rules have the same structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "    <weight>  <parent>  <child1>  <child2>   <child3>  ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "`<weight>` is an integer value. Weights allow you to express your knowledge of which English phenomena are common and which ones are rare. By giving a low weight to a rule, you express a belief that it doesn't occur very often in English.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a probabilistic CFG, each rule has some probability associated with it, and the probability of a derivation for a sentence is the product of all the rules that went into the derivation. I don't want you to worry about making probabilities sum up to one in this exercise, though, so you can use any positive number as a weight. The code renormalizes them for you so that the weights for all the rules which rewrite a given non-terminal form a valid probability distribution (you're welcome).\n",
        "\n",
        "`<parent>` is a non-terminal symbol. All children (e.g. `<child1>`) are either terminals or non-terminals. The parser will basically treat any symbols for which the grammar contains no rewrite rules as terminals and throw an error if it finds any such terminals not in the allowed words list. Also note that lines beginning with the `#` symbol are comments and are ignored. You can give any of the utilities a set of files containing such rules, and they will merge the rules in each file into a single\n",
        "grammar.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can change these files however you like, and you can create new ones, too. However, this can't be stressed enough, you must not create new vocabulary words (terminals).\n",

        "## Weighting S1 and S2\n",
        "\n",
        "Two rules your grammar must include are `START -> S1` and `START -> S2`. (By default, these rules are in S1.gr.) The relative weight of these determines how likely it is that S1.gr (with start symbol S1) or S2.gr (with start symbol S2) would be selected in generating a sentence, and how costly it is to choose one or the other when parsing a sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing the relative weight of these two rules is a gamble. If you are over-confident in your `real' English grammar (S1), and you weight it too highly, then you risk assigning very low probability to sentences which S1 cannot generate (since the parser will have to resort to your S2 to get a parse, which gives every sentence a low score).  But if you weight S2 too highly, then you will probably do a poor job of predicting the test set sentences, since S2 will not make any sentences very likely. (It accepts everything, so probability mass is spread very thin across the space of word strings.) Of course, you can invest some effort in trying to make S2 a better n-gram model, but that's a tedious task and a risky investment."

There are a number of ways to enforce the requirement that no string has zero probability under S2; I give you one to start with, and you are free to change it. Just note that your parser's score will become infinitely bad if you ever give zero probability to a sentence.\n",
